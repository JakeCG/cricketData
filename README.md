# Cricket Data

A side project to collate data based upon cricket teams.  
  
Currently no UI available, so change line 37 of src/app.js to find which data you want.  

You will also need an API key for free from: https://cricketdata.org/, this should be placed in a config.js file, in the src directory, under a value set by 'APIKey:'.
